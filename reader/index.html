        The real problem with pop-up ads, though, is that they've been abused by marketers for years. Even without the scams, virus downloads and other illegitimate uses of pop-up ads, marketers have been so aggressive with pop-ups over the years that many people have a knee-jerk negative reaction as soon as they see one.

        “I love pop-up ads,” said nobody…ever. Pop-up ads have to be one of the most universally hated parts of online marketing. They're annoying, interruptive and distracting. In fact, they're so generally loathed that their inventor, Ethan Zuckerman, has apologized publicly for creating them.

        Now, some companies have tried to rebrand these sorts of pop-up ads using fancy titles like “exit overlays,” but at the end of the day, a pop-up ad is still a pop-up ad. It pops up on the user’s screen, hijacks their experience and bugs the heck out of people. But here’s the thing. There’s a reason why pop-up ads are still so commonly used. They work. Quite well, in fact. The problem with pop-up ads isn’t necessarily that the ads themselves are bad, it’s that most marketers don’t know how to use them effectively.

        The good news is, with the right strategy, pop-up ads can actually be a very effective way to convince people to sign up for your email list, become a lead or buy your products. You simply have to figure out how to provide value…and minimize frustration. So, in this article, we’re going to take a look at why pop-up ads can be so effective, why most people dislike them, and how to use pop-up ads in a way that works – for you and your site traffic. Let’s dive in!

        The power of the pop-up

    <div class="text5">
        Why do people hate pop-ups? Because they interrupt the user experience. You’re in the middle of checking out a website or searching for something specific and then, suddenly, a giant pop-up ad appears, forcing you to look at it, pay attention to it and deal with it.

        Which, incidentally, is why pop-up ads work so well.

    <div class="text7">
        One of the biggest problems with online advertising is figuring out how to get people to pay attention to your ads. Banner blindness is a very real thing, and if your ad doesn’t interrupt the user experience in some way, people often won’t even notice your ads. Pop-up ads, however, force people to pay attention to them in the same way that YouTube ads and TV commercials do. With a pop-up ad, you don’t have to wonder whether or not people will see your ad – they’ll definitely see it, even if their only interaction with your ad is trying to get rid of it.

        Creating pop-up ads that users actually like
    </div>

    <div class="text9">
        If you want to get good results from your pop-up ads, they have to provide value. Remember, three-quarters of your site traffic will instantly be annoyed by the appearance of a pop-up ad, so you’re starting in a pretty bad place. To recover, you need to offer enough value that people will be willing to forgive your advertising faux pas.

        Think about it like this. On a Saturday evening when you’re trying to relax and catch your breath from the day’s chores, an unexpected knock at the door can feel like a real inconvenience. If it’s an aggressive salesperson at the door, how open are you going to be to their pitch? Odds are, you’ll be looking for the quickest out you can find. A friendly neighbor carrying a plate full of cookies, on the other hand, will probably get a much warmer reception.
